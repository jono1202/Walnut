                      WALNUT 5 Additional Documentation

This new version of Walnut has new capabilities and changes added by Anatoly Zavyalov (anatoly.zavyalov@mail.utoronto.ca), with direction from Jeffrey Shallit (shallit@uwaterloo.ca).

The new capabilities are as follows:

#1:	Transducing k-automatic sequences
#2: Converting number systems
#3: Reversing word automata
#4: Minimizing word automata
#5: Changes to the reversal (`) operation
#6: Improvements to logging
#7: Bug fixes



#1: 	Transducing k-automatic sequences.

One may now transduce automata (that have at most one edge per input per two states) with the following syntax:

	transduce <new> <TRANSDUCER> <old>

For example, if trying to transduce a word automaton T saved in Word Automata Library/T.txt using a transducer named RUNSUMmod2 saved in Transducer Library/RUNSUMmod2.txt, one may write the following:

	transduce new_T RUNSUMmod2 T;

The above command will save a new word automaton new_T in the directory Word Automata Library/.

To transduce automata saved in Automata Library/, one may add a prefix of '$' (without the quotation marks) to the automaton name. For example, if trying to transduce the automaton xda saved in Automata Library/xda.txt using a transducer named RUNSUMmod2 saved in Transducer Library/RUNSUMmod2.txt, one may write the following:

	transduce another_T RUNSUMmod2 $xda;

The above command will save a new word automaton another_T in the directory Word Automata Library/.

To define a transducer, create a .txt file in the Transducer Library/ folder in the Walnut directory with the desired name of the transducer. Transducers are defined similarly to automata, with the exception of an output at the end of each transition. The accepted format for writing transitions is as follows:

<input> -> <new state> / <output>

Currently, as the implementation of transducers in Walnut involves an underlying automaton, state outputs and a number system must also be written (as in definitions for automata), however state outputs may just be arbitrarily set by the user (as they are not considered in the transduction algorithm). The number system should be set to msd_k, where k is the size of the input alphabet. This will be made optional in a future version. 

Below is an example transducer definition with three states, computing the XOR of adjacent bits in a sequence over {0, 1} (with the first output always being 0):


msd_2

0 0
0 -> 1 / 0
1 -> 2 / 0

1 0
0 -> 1 / 0
1 -> 2 / 1

2 0
0 -> 1 / 1
1 -> 2 / 0



#2:		Converting number systems

One may now convert the number system of an Automaton or a Word Automaton with one input from a base of k^i to /k^j, where k, i and j are positive integers with k >= 2. Note that this allows for conversions from msd to lsd, lsd to msd and vice versa, and lsd to lsd. The following syntax is used:

	convert <new> <numberSystem> <old>
	
For example, to transduce a Word Automaton T saved in Word Automata Library/T.txt to msd_8 (assuming T is in msd_2), one runs:
	
	convert T_new msd_8 T;

The above command will save a new word automaton T_new in the directory Word Automata Library/.

To convert the number system of an Automaton saved in Automata Library/, one may add a prefix of '$' (without the quotation marks) to the old automaton's name. For example, if trying to transduce the Automaton quag saved in Automata Library/quag.txt from msd_2 to lsd_16 and save it as a Word Automaton, one runs:

	convert quag_new lsd_16 $quag;
	
The above command will save a new word automaton quag_new in the directory Word Automata Library/.
	
If the resulting base of the new automaton is 2 (that is, the new number system is either msd_2 or lsd_2), then one may save the resulting automaton as an Automaton in the Automata Library/ directory, by adding a prefix of '$' (without the quotation marks) to the new automaton's name. For example, if elephant is a Word Automaton over the number system lsd_32, one can run:

	convert $elephant_new msd_2 elephant;

The above command will save a new automaton elephant_new in the directory Automata Library/.



#3: 	Reversing word automata


One may now reverse a Word Automaton, with the following syntax:

	reverse <new> <old>
	
NOTE: Reversing an automaton will flip the number system from msd to lsd, and vice versa.
	
For example, if reversing a word automaton DEJ saved in Word Automata Library/DEJ.txt with a number system of msd_19, one runs:

	reverse DEJ_new DEJ;

DEJ_new will be a Word Automatonthat is the reverse of DEJ, with a number system of lsd_19, and will be saved in Word Automata Library/.

NOTE: If trying to reverse a word automaton with undefined transitions, a distinguished dead state with an output of min{-1, min{outputs} - 1} will be created (where min{outputs} is the minimum output of the original word automaton) and all undefined transitions will be instead sent to this dead state.

NOTE: To reverse Automata (those saved in Automata Library/), use the ` operator.



#4: 	Minimizing word automata


One may now minimize a Word Automaton, with the following syntax:

	minimize <new> <old>
	
For example, if minimizing a word automaton NOTMIN saved in Word Automata Library/NOTMIN.txt, one runs:

	reverse MIN NOTMIN;

MIN will be a minimal Word Automaton equivalent to NOTMIN, and will be saved in Word Automata Library/.




#5: 	Changes to the reversal (`) operation.

Reversing an automaton using the '`' operation will now change its number system(s) from msd to lsd, and vice versa.



#6: 	Improvements to logging.

Commands that involve determinizing or taking the cross product of automata that are ran with the ':' or '::' suffices (without the quotation marks) will now include further logging that update the user on how many states have been added so far, how many states remain in the queue, and how many states have been reached in total so far.



#7: 	Bug fixes are as follows:

	- Fixed bug that prevented subset construction of automata with large amounts of states in certain cases.
	- Fixed bug that did not allow to combine automata with negative integer outputs
